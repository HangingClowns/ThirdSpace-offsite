# Xccelerate Engineering Offsite Test 

Here lies a take-home project to see if you have the technical chops to work at Third Space! 

## Getting Started

* `yarn`
* `yarn start:<PACKAGE_DIR>` OR `yarn start` should you wish to serve both the frontend and backend in parallel

## Requirements

In addition to your frequent commits, please ensure your code is: 
- Clean and reusable (follow SOLID principles)
- Following the best practices of the corresponding platform
- Documented (pro-tip: use JSDoc!)
- Performant and efficient (low memory consumption)

Please also ensure you write tests for your functions, using Jest and relevant JS libraries.

### Backend


### Frontend

You are going to build a React App that comprises of three pages: 

1. Main Lobby
2. Student Classroom
3. Instructor Dashboard

#### Main Lobby

This should be the first page the user sees. It should have the following:

- Select component to select student or instructor.
- Input text field for user to enter a room id.
- Button that takes the user to the Student Classroom or Instructor Dashboard depending on his/her role.

#### Student Classroom

The Student Classroom should contain a Code Editor with three panels. 

1. Left Panel
  - This is the section for package dependencies

2. Middle Panel -> Code input
  - This is the input section for students to input code.
  - The font style and color should mimic an IDE.

3. Right Panel -> Code output
  - This is the Output panel

- Between the middle and the right panel, there should be a "Run" button. The button should run the input code (from the server) and output its results on the right panel.
- The Code Editor should be able to handle Python and Javascript.
- Above the Code Editor there should be a “Run” button. 
- The button should run the input code (from the server) and output its results on the right panel. 
- The panels should be adjustable in width (draggable).
- The middle and right panels should be copy-pastable.
- The Code Editor does not need to be mobile-responsive.

#### Instructor Dashboard

The 


## Requirements
- Documentation
- Code must be documented (pro-tip: use JSDoc)
- Code must be reusable and follow SOLID principles
- Optimize code for efficiency and modularity

 Node, Express, and ReactJS. Your coding editor 


Start by not writing any code.

```

```

This is just an example application, but imagine it doing anything you want. Adding new features is easy too:

```

```

The possibilities are endless.

### Building the Application

Now that you have not done anything it's time to build your application:

```

```

Yep. That's it. You should see the following output:

```

```

### Deploying

While you still have not done anything it's time to deploy your application. By running the following command you can deploy your application absolutely nowhere.

```

```

It's that simple. And when it comes time to scale the application, all you have to do is:

```

```

I know right?
